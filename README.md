## ðŸ”‘ Environment Setup

This project integrates with [NocoDB](https://nocodb.com/) to fetch and display product data and store the bookings. You'll need to set up environment variables to connect to your NocoDB instance.

### Setting Up Environment Variables

1. Create a `.env` file in the root of your project (or copy `.env.example` and rename it to `.env`)
2. Add the following variables to your `.env` file:

```
# NocoDB API Configuration
# The API token for authenticating with NocoDB
NOCODB_API_TOKEN=your_nocodb_api_token_here
# The NocoDB API endpoint URL for retrieving records
# Example: https://app.nocodb.com/api/v2/tables/{table_id}/records
PRODUCTS_TABLE_URL=your_nocodb_api_endpoint_here
BOOKING_TABLE_URL=your_nocodb_bookings_table
```

### Getting NocoDB Values

1. **API Token**: Log into your NocoDB dashboard, go to Settings > API tokens, and create or copy an existing token
2. **API URL**: This is the endpoint for your table data, formatted as: `https://app.nocodb.com/api/v2/tables/{table_id}/records`

### Important Notes

- Never commit your `.env` file to version control (it's already in `.gitignore`)
- The `.env.example` file is provided as a template and can be safely committed
- For local development, make sure to restart your development server after changing environment variables
